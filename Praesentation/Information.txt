Pitch 
refers to the frequency of the sound, or how high or low it is and is represented with the letters 
[A, B, C, D, E, F, G], with A being the highest and G being the lowest.

Octave 
refers to which set of pitches you use on a piano.

Offset 
refers to where the note is located in the piece.

LSTM 
layers is a Recurrent Neural Net layer that takes a sequence as an input and 
can return either sequences (return_sequences=True) or a matrix.

Dropout 
layers are a regularisation technique that consists of setting a fraction of 
input units to 0 at each update during the training to prevent overfitting. 
The fraction is determined by the parameter used with the layer.

Dense 
layers or fully connected layers is a fully connected neural network layer 
where each input node is connected to each output node.

The Activation layer 
determines what activation function our neural network will use to calculate the output of a node.
